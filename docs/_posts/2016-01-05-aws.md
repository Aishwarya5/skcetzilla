   We the contributors of the Mozilla community in the name SKCETZILLA are delighted saying that we have succesfully conducted a hands on session on Git and GitHub with around 50 participants at our college premises.
   A brief idea about Git and GitHub is delivered by Tharunkumar and Balaji Venkatesan.Aishwarya related these concepts with a real time scenario and gave a short note on the applications of Git and GitHub followed by an one and a half hour Git session took over by Lokeshwaran.Rohith,Manoj,Manoj Kumar were assisting the participantsin executing the commands.At the end of the session Prashanth took over the GitHub session.
   All the students were studious throughout the session and were interested in joining the SKCETZILLA and start contributing to the Mozilla community.
   We are about to conduct many events in the future inorder to make our college students familiar about Mozilla community.We'll continue contributing to the Comunity and we'll rise and shine...
